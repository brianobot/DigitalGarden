# Sai Yashwanth


Welcome to my personal website. I am Sai Yashwanth, an engineer, builder and a writer. 
I am currently working as a Founding AI Engineer at Vuhosi. Here's my [cv](./resume)

Check my chronologically ordered [proof of work.](./timeline) This basically a timeline of my work, achievements, and experiences.

I started [Turi Labs](https://www.turilabs.tech) - Indie AI Research Lab. 

> Goal: Build local AGI from my bedroom :P

I love building stuff with code, writing, reading, playing football and working out (currently learning calisthenic skills and enjoying it). 
I believe in the idea of becoming "multidimensionally jacked" - body, mind, knowledge, skills, communication, finance. 
The idea is to max out all aspects of life.


Although I am very lazy and sometimes lack the motivation or the urge to take actions, I am actively trying to fix my life in this regard. 

### Map
- [Essays](./articles): I got this habbit of writing and I love it. Here's a collection of all the stuff I have written.

## A typical day in my life
Apart from work, I try to follow this routine:

- Training: Lift weights (currently also learning calisthenics). 
- Eating: Eat clean (high protein, less carbs, more healthy fats). Atleast 90% of the time.
- Reading: Read books (self help), blogs (mostly related to the work I do and get paid for). I am currently reading [The Almanack of Naval Ravikant](https://navalmanack.com/)
- Writing: Practice writing daily (or atleast often).
- Hacking: Work on my projects, and research.

In my free time, I am reading books on business, finance and tech. Here's my philosophy on [reading](content/reading)

I also love playing games. Favorite ones: [Ghost of Tsushima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_of_Tsushima), [Uncharted 4.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_4:_A_Thief%27s_End)
Currently playing: [Rdr2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption_2)
