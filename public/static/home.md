# Sai Yashwanth


Welcome to my personal website. I am Sai Yashwanth, an engineer, builder and a writer.

I am currently working as an AI Research Engineer at Vuhosi (we are building a copilot for investors and founders), where I read a lot of papers and build ai agents. 
I am also writing research papers, books and making videos (sometimes) about AI. In my free time, I am learning gamedev using the godot engine. 
This is my hobby, the reason why I chose CS as my major (although I got sucked into other domains later).

> Goal: Build local AGI from my bedroom :P


I love building stuff with code, writing, playing football and working out (currently learning calisthenics, really love it). I believe in the idea of becoming "multidimensionally jacked" - 
body, mind, knowledge, skills, communication, finance. The idea is to max out all aspects of life.
Although I am very lazy and sometimes lack the motivation or the urge to take actions, I am actively trying to fix my life in this regard.
