# Brian Obot

Welcome to my personal website. I am Brian Obot, an Engineer, builder and a writer. 
I am currently working as the Lead Backend Engineer at Vuhosi, leading the development of backend infrastructure for AI agents and automation workflows. Here's my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q8O224GCpInFMhEHbFgVfyDXQu5dJ0cZZC5wYpwSQvE/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank">[CV]</a>

Want to know me better? Check my chronologically ordered [proof of work.](./timeline) This is basically a timeline of my work, achievements, and experiences over the years.

I run an indie ai research lab called [Turi Labs.](https://www.turilabs.tech) Check it out.

I love building stuff with code, writing, reading, playing football and working out. I believe in the idea of becoming "multidimensionally jacked" - body, mind, knowledge, skills, communication, finance. The idea is to max out all aspects of life.

Although I am very lazy and sometimes lack the motivation or the urge to take actions, I am actively trying to fix my life in this regard. I will write about my experiments and observations fixing my body and mind soon. 

### Map
If you are here, you probably should know how I organized this space. Now let me be honest, Most of the stuff here is a work in progress. But I take my sweet time out to update this website. To me, this is my digital journal. 

- [Essays](./articles): I got this habbit of writing and I love it. Here's a collection of all the stuff I have written.
- [Projects](./projects): A showcase of all the projects I have worked on. (Might be incomplete)
- [Timeline](./timeline): A chronological view of my journey, achievements, and experiences.
- [Reading List (wip)](./reading-list): A compilation of books, articles, and papers that I have read or plan to read.


## A typical day in my life
Apart from work, I try to follow this routine:

- Training: Lift weights (currently also learning calisthenics).
- Eating: Eat clean (high protein, less carbs, more healthy fats). Atleast 90% of the time.
- Reading: Read books (self help), blogs (mostly related to the work I do and get paid for). I am currently reading [The Almanack of Naval Ravikant.](https://navalmanack.com/)
- Writing: Practice writing daily (or atleast often).
- Hacking: Work on my projects, and research.

In my free time, I am reading books on business, finance and tech. Here's my philosophy on [reading](content/reading)

I also love playing games. Favorite ones: [Ghost of Tsushima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_of_Tsushima), [Uncharted 4.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_4:_A_Thief%27s_End)
Currently playing: [Rdr2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption_2)
