Welcome to my personal website. This is where I will be sharing all the stuff I have done related to tech.


## Map

Here's a rough map of this website:
* __[Projects](./projects)__: List of all the Projects I have worked on since I started this journey of computer science.

* __[Articles](./articles)__: List of some of the articles I have written. I try to share my learnings by writing articles, in hopes of helping someone in some way.

__[Resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-OqzfYF25iUmStaX3Ab5BQlg8hyEi8BKh_dc1fZmyZI/edit?usp=sharing)__ - Heres my resume

## Languages that I use
Languages are just a medium to solve a problem. I love coding and solving problems using code.
- __Javascript__: Been using js to build frontend, backend for few of my projects. Love this language
- __Python__: My first programming language. Spent a lot of time trying to figure out things using this language.
- __Rust__: My favorite language to code in. Still learning a lot, building small projects and step by step getting comfortable with rust. 
- __Golang__: Currently trying to build small backend projects/services in golang. Will be working a lot with go in 2024 
- __C++__: Never built an "actual" project using cpp but i have coded a lot in cpp thanks to leetcode
