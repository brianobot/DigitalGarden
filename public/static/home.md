Here's a rough map of this website:
* __[Projects](./projects)__: List of all the Projects I have worked on since I started this journey of computer science.

## Languages that I use
Languages are just a medium to solve a problem. I love coding and solving problems using code.
- __Typescript__: Stricter js, my go to for complex projects (this is coming after I wasted hours using javascript).
- __Javascript__: Been using js to build frontend, backend for few of my projects. Love this language.
- __Python__: My first programming language. Spent a lot of time trying to figure out things using this language.
- __Rust__: My favorite language to code in. Still learning a lot, building small projects and step by step getting comfortable with rust. 
- __Golang__: Currently trying to build small backend projects/services in golang. Will be working a lot with go in 2024. 
- __C++__: Never built an "actual" project using cpp but i have coded a lot in cpp thanks to leetcode.
