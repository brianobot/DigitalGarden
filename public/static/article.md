I love writing. It shapes my thoughts and my personality in general. My goal is to write mini essays on a regular basis (Raw unfiltered thoughts and learnings). 
Aim is to create more than what I consume.


Writing is the best way to re-learn.

## Series:
Some of my mini essays are part of a same larger topic. Hence I have put them as a series of posts.
