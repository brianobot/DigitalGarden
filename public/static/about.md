Hi there! My name is Sai Yashwanth, I am an engineer and a writer. I love building stuff and writing about them online. I also like solving problems using tech. 


I recently got started as Head of AI at Plotweaver. I am building AI agents for the company.
I am currently writing a book on AI Agents which should be out in a few months. 

I recently discovered that I kind of like teaching. Sharing my knowledge with others. I aim to create content in my style and put it out there.

Currently working on:
- [TuriLabs](https://turilabs.tech): An indie research lab. The plan is to create hobby projects and write about them.
