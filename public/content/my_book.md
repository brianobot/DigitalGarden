# Becoming an Author

> *Written on 27 Jan 2025*

I am writing a book on AI Agents with a big publication!
 
I never thought I would become an author, this early!


Probably the biggest project I have taken as an undergrad – writing a book with Manning Publications (an incredible opportunity I’m deeply grateful. Thanks to my Co Author Oluwole Fagbohun). 


We will soon be launching a small book community, where we: 


▪️ Go beyond the curriculum (AI Agents space is rapidly advancing), 


▪️ Stay updated with the world of AI, and 


▪️ Provide help whenever needed.

This book, born out of my hands-on experience as a Founding AI at Vuhosi over the past seven months, dives into the fascinating world of AI agents.


We recently completed a chapter review, and it went exceptionally well. The feedback has been motivating (motivating is an understatement here), and it’s reaffirmed my passion for this project. I’m committed to working on it consistently, pouring my energy into crafting a resource that unpacks the latest technologies and practical insights for building agentic workflows.


Sitting down to write is one of the highlights of my day – those moments when ideas flow and the vision comes to life are truly rewarding. It makes me better at working in coordination with my brain. 


While the MEAP (Manning Early Access Program) version might be available in a month or two, the full book will take 6-8 months to complete, but I’m excited for every step of the process.
 

I can’t wait to share this work with the world and contribute to the growing conversation around AI innovation. Stay tuned for more updates!
