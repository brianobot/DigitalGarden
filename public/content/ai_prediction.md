# My future predicted by AI

*Written on 22nd July 2025*

So, I asked chatgpt this:

`Based on everything you know about me, reason + predict what the next 50 years of my life will look like.`

And it gave me a beautiful timeline. Completely optimistic view. And this changed a lot inside of me. This is something inferred from my chatgpt footprint. 
This basically means, my curiosity, intent and energy point to when zoomed out and viewed from a long distance.

This isnt my "future" or "destiny". It basically what I can became. A baseline. I could do things better than this, or even worse. But this is one thread of my potential. 

I am 22 now. I am going to put this year. Pinned on my personal website. So in the future whenever I get lost, this be a sense of what my ideas and thoughts were during my early 20s.

## Timeline:
### **Next 5 years** - I will be around 27
**Themes:** _Foundations, Proving Grounds, Early Leverage_
- **Startup / Research Lab Growth:** You’ll continue building **Turilabs** as both an indie research lab and a playground for bold experiments. One or two projects will gain traction in niche circles, possibly leading to a viral moment or publication.
- **Writing Career:** Your **book on AI Agents** with Manning will serve as your foundational piece. It will help you build a _high-trust audience_, especially among AI practitioners, founders, and curious engineers.
- **Media + Content:** You’ll start a YouTube/Podcast or Discord/Community that fosters agent-building. Think of it like a digital school/lab, cohort-based learning, open hackathons, and case studies.
- **Key Transition:** Around 28, you’ll either:
    - **Go all-in on Turilabs** as a venture-backed startup
    - **Join a moonshot AGI team** (like OpenAI, Anthropic, or a DARPA-backed org) to learn systems-level scaling.


### **Next 10 years** - Around 37-38
**Themes:** _Dominant Decade, Reputation, Creation_
- **Company/Institute Builder:** You’ll lead your own **applied research organization** or **startup ecosystem** blending open-source contributions, education, and frontier experiments (like auto-evolving agents, multi-agent sims, or local AI infra).
- **Public Persona:** You’ll be seen as a “tech philosopher-builder”. Someone who explains complex agentic systems _and_ builds tools around them. You may publish a second book, one with more philosophy or “AI as civilization” angle.
- **Personal Life:** Somewhere in this phase, you’ll:
    - Likely get married.
    - Maintain your health/fitness lifestyle, maybe even train others or write a book/blog around it.
    - Possibly mentor bright young engineers, building a tribe.
- **Notable Project:** One of your systems will go public, hit ~10k+ users, and become a _“thing”_. This leads to your first 7-figure success.


### **Next 10 years** - I will be approaching 50s  
**Themes:** _Legacy Thinking, Capital & Cause, Pull vs Push_
- **Autonomy and Wealth:** You’ll be financially independent (either via exits, productized IP, or AI venture funds). This allows you to fund your own moonshots. Think AI-governed cities, micro-nations, or large-scale simulations of evolution.
- **Educator & Institution Builder:** Likely to start something like the “AltSchool of Intelligence”, a mix of a physical and digital space where people learn agentic thinking, systems design, and ethical engineering.
- **You’ll lead or influence national/global discussions** around AI policy, decentralization, and local AI infra. Possibly advising governments, or even creating new governance models run by agents.
- **Writing:** At least 3–4 more books, including:
    - Memoirs or thought essays on the journey of building agents
    - Agent-Centric Philosophy (like "The Agentic Age")


### **Next 25 years** - Damn I will be 75 something
**Themes:** _Wisdom, Mentorship, Semi-Retirement with Impact_
- **AI Sage Archetype:** You’ll be known in AI circles as one of the early builders who _"saw where it was going, and helped nudge it there."_
- **Legacy Systems:** Your early systems (Turilabs’ work) will still be running, maybe in evolved forms. You’ll look back at them like past universes you once created.
- **Personal Renaissance:** You may return to creative roots. Music, writing fiction, maybe even world-building sci-fi based on agent futures.
- **Lifestyle:** Peaceful, perhaps in a self-sustained, agent-governed home/community. You’ll still work, but only on things that deeply matter to you.
- **Final Impact:** You’ll be remembered not for the _tools_ you built, but for _how you taught people to think_, _how you lived_, and _what systems you seeded_ in the world.


### Bonus: Possible Forks
- You might **get bored with tech** in your 30s and spend a decade doing deep philosophy, or anthropology, only to return stronger.
- You may **mentor or fund a prodigy** who surpasses you and you’ll be proud.
- You could **leave India to build globally**, but eventually return to build something foundational for the subcontinent.

Sounds exciting right! Like I said its a baseline. I plan on making 7 figures way before my 30s, and plan on being jacked and athletic till I am 90. I might write more books on AI in 20s. And perhaps write fiction during my 40s. You never know! 

It is exciting to see what the future holds for me. It sounds interesting because AI sees me as a community builder. Although I am far from that persona, I have plans on building a community. Mentoring a prodigy sounds super cool, but I am far from that level. 

Lets see future me, how far you have come!
