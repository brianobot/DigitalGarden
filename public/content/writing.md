What is the most important skill I would want to re-learn?

Writing.
In this age of AI, writing can be "automated" and mass produced at incredible speed. 

Then why am I alpha about writing?

The most basic form of writing as a skill is very crucial for development of our minds. As humans, we have insane number of thoughts daily. Throughout history, those who were able to put their thoughts into words (eventually these words together forming meaning) came out on top. 

I clearly see it, If I am able to write well, I could reach a lot of people, helping me in forming meaningful connections. (This is very very underestimated, I got a full time high paying job through this). This skill clearly has asymmetric results. 

This very skill is also the foundation for everything in this age. Content creation, Sales, Marketing..... You name it. Being skilled in writing will get you to top. 

So this makes sense , now how to get started? 
What I am doing - 
1. Reading good books. (I was never good at this, but I am making it a habit)

2. Writing. Just try putting your thoughts into words. Verbalize your thoughts. Just like any other skill, the more time you put, the better you become.

3. Share online. Nobody cares, so just put it. It has asymmetric returns, Might change your life (did for me).

I honestly write whatever would have been useful to the past me. It also helps a lot of people, and I get views and likes which makes me happy. I connect to people, my network grows. Its helpful in all ways
