MCP is a standard way of giving arms, legs, and context to an LLM. With all of these, LLMs can do much more than they could without them.


We could provide all of these (limbs and context) to an LLM in the traditional way—by giving access to functions as tools, and for context, we could use a RAG tool. 
However, what makes MCP useful is the ease of integrating these limbs, especially for someone who is a non-coder.


You don’t have to code. Just add MCP servers provided by other cool developers into your client and enjoy.


Another reason why everyone likes MCP is that it serves as a standard for creating these arms and legs for LLMs. Previously, we had to write a tool in Python and provide that to an LLM (via code, of course).


Now, we have a standard process for this. Everyone in this space seems to loce this open protocol.


Think about it: MCP makes it easy to build agents now.


`Agents = LLMs + memory + limbs` 


This is what I have been discussing in all my previous posts on AI agents (do check them out).


Maybe I should start a similar series on MCP, like I did with AI agents.
