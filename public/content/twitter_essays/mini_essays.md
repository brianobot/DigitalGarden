Recently, my posts on twitter started getting thousands of views, giving me 100s of followers. This has enabled me to connect to a lot of founders and CEOs, talking to them and having calls, discussing AI Agents. This truly made me appreciate "Build in Public" which is what I have been doing for the past 3-4 years, since the start of my college as a CS undergrad.

These posts are mini essays about AI Agents. Particularly, my learning and understandings from building AI Agents at Vuhosi. I also share the same stuff on linkedin (Although I dont get the same response XD)

Now I have decided to collect my posts on my personal website. This would eventually help someone trying to get into agents (Or maybe perhaps, it would help the future me)

It has been good start to this year. I have written close to 6 posts in the last one month, getting over 200k impressions and crossing 1k followers on twitter. This has boosted my motivation and purpose to write more such essays.
