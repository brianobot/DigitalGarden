# A New Age of Learning

1990s was where skills like memory was praised, soon google search and wikipedia made it not so important. there was a shift in late 2000s to 2010s, from memory to problem solving. 
I think we might see a similar shift, from problem solving to perhaps AI whisperer? (Lmao prompt engineering). although it might sound silly, but i feel being quick in taking actions, being good at communication will be the key
With the fall in attention span, Communication skill wil change. Simple and quick communicators, who can give the whole idea in less words will be winners (?)
