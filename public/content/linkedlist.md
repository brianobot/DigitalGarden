## Linked List
This article covers single linked list.

A Linked List is basically nodes connected or linked to each other. We will discuss how they are linked together.

A node is basically a block which contains a data and a pointer which points to the data of the next nodeâ€™s data or points to null if that block is the last node in the list.

```c
struct node
{
    int data;
    struct node *next;
};
// We created a structure named node. It has data and a pointer named next.
```

How to initialise the linkedlist?

In the main function, We first create a node called head which is the first node and it is used as reference node to transverse through the list.

```c
int main()
{
    struct node *head;
        // creating head node
    head = (struct node *)malloc(sizeof(struct node));
        // allocating memory
    head->data = 45;
        // head node's data 
    head->next = NULL;
        // head node's next pointer points to null as we have only one element.

    return 0;
}

```
We now have a list with one element 45.

We can simply add more values for the time being to see how it works.

```c
int main()
{
    struct node *head;
    head = (struct node *)malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    head->data = 5;
    head->next = NULL;

    struct node *current = (struct node *)malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    current->data = 98;
    current->next = NULL;
        // we create a second node current and the next pointer points to null as only two elements are present.
    head->next = current;
        // we assign the head node's next pointer to current. That means it stores the address of 98.   

    current = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    current->data = 34;
    current->next = NULL;
        // we assign this node's next pointer to null.
    head->next->next = current;
        // head->next->next should point to the address of 34. 

    return 0;
}

```
This code should give me a list

5 98 34

The first node contains integer data 5 and address of 98, Second node contains data 98 and address of 34. The third node contains 34 and next pointer points to null.
