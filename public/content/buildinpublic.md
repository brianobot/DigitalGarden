## Build in Public

Why building in public works? This is the 10th offer I got reached out for without actively looking for one. There is an abundance of opportunities. I thought of sharing my thoughts on this, as it might be helpful to someone, or perhaps to my future self if I ever lose motivation

Learn something, write about it online, even if you think you are not good at it yet. Let people see, Let people read. 

Write in your own words, your own experience. Create value, don't shitpost. 

Provide value even if you think you are not as knowledgeable. Keep iterating this step and improving. This is not a lecture, this is what I am doing actively. My experience. 

This is is what I have been doing since the first semester of college, and by iterating through the last 3-4 years, I learnt a lot and I am still learning. Break the barrier of shyness and just put out your thoughts, let people judge (fun fact, no one gives a damn about your life)

Ofcourse, there are people who did much better than me in-terms of "numbers" in the last 1 year (3 times lesser than me), but I learnt a lot about me. And that is more important than online "number". The goal/purpose is not numbers but it is to provide value even if your stuff doesn't work in terms of numbers. 

Keep providing value, don't shitpost or post for the sake of numbers, keep value in your priority list, experiment, iterate and you will notice that your career/business has become much more easier. 

This principle is also discussed in Varun Mayya's latest book on content creation which I have been reading from few days.

So yea, just write your thoughts and put them up. Who knows what kind of opportunity awaits.

PS: I referred my friend for that since I already have a job
