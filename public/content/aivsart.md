# AI vs Art?


I have been seeing a lot of arguments in the past one week, where a lot of artists are against the use of AI for art. Tags like -> #Cheatgpt #NoAI and many more.

Well this emotion is pretty much expected, and I am afraid there will be a lot more in the coming few years. AGI will completely change the economy as we see it. Many of our "jobs" will be replaced for real. But this is where I draw a line. 

Well for those who don't know me,  I am all for AI. (I have bet all my 16 years of education in AI (more specifically AI Agents) by not sitting in college placements which is like taking a huge jump with no safety net. And I am all in for this risk. Probably the best decision of my life)

I am putting all of my spare time into building machines which mimic human thinking and I actually love this process.

Lets get back to the main topic.

"Art" is not a job. Its not a profession. Sure there are people who draw for a living, and they mostly make content. This is kind of philosphical, but art is more than content. 

Art is a way to express emotions. It is a way to tell story. And for sure AI wont be doing this. AI is just a lot of math to predict next sequence with a bit of randomness. There's no story/emotions. None of that. 

So why the outrage? When these "Artist" were using AI to generate captions, ideas and whatnot, there was no rebel against AI. But when AI gets as good as what we see now, to do anime art and what not, thats when a lot of these people are raising their voices. 

The reason is probably two things
1. Using internet data for training is fine when it was text corpus. But when u take all the "art" done by artists without their consent and train, That's some crime boss. And this is wrong
2. AI can create content faster than an artist ever could. And this is true for all other domains where AI could do. Copywriting? Yessir. Programming? Hell yes. We devs have seen it last year. Heck, infact I myself built Devyan way before bolt or lovable, and I remember I was telling my friends Devyan will replace us.

The last point is the one which is biting everyone's ass. Why will someone pay an artist, when we can have art done by these machines which are faster and cheaper. 
Unless you are famous in this field, you are cooked. And this is why I was telling AGI will change the economy completely. This is true for poets, writers, and even musicians. 

## Who is at fault here?ï¿¼

Its the people who consume these. I am not with AI in this argument. Recently read this manga "The Climber", and one of the mangaka apparently left, and since the other who was an artist knew nothing can be done, he just did whatever he felt like and it was a masterpiece. One of the finest piece of story I ever read. 

AI wont be able to do this. But the problem, people will consume this AI slop, and it is not the fault of those who create using AI. It is the people who consume it. I open linkedin and I see AI slop. People wont stop from liking this slop, boosting the algo and ofcourse everyone will do the same since this is what is getting views. 

I write blogs on a topic. I read books. I research. I use AI and talk with it. I challenge it, we go on and on. And this is how my thinking forms. AI is my buddy with which I argue, scold, and thank later. This is a huge process, but the stuff I write after this is gold. But whats the point if AI can do this in seconds? There is a point. Its the self satisfaction I get.

If you are an artist against AI, and your argument is AI cant express emotions, I do, so please lets stop AI - Then boss you need to do go back and figure out "your self". Because an true artist will do what he wants, without worrying about the world. That's when stuff like "The Climber" is produced.
