# Computers are cool. Lets learn about them

> *Written on Apr 1, 2025*

We all use computers. Laptops, smartphones, tablets what not. Probably the coolest invention mankind has ever made. I was fascinated by them from an early age. 

Yet, I never attempted at learning how they actually work. I took Computer Science as my major, but I never really learned about their internal workings (probably because I was sleeping in class when they taught it).

I recently stumbled upon on this book called "The Pattern on the Stone", and it is mindblowing. I really liked the concept of this book. It basically takes you through the ideas which lead to the internal working of a computer.

I wanted to write my own thoughts after reading the book, and hence this series. Writing is one of my most favorite things, and I want to definitely get my hands dirty especially with this topic.

So I basically like going top down. I think that's the most fun way. Play at the application level, then maybe after some time dig one or two levels deeper and play there. Again after some time dig even more. This is fun, and suits my personality. But for this series lets go **bottom-up** (the book itself goes this way).

Computers are built from tiny switches called transistors. So that's where we will start our journey. From tiny switches to compilers and interpreters which allows us to write programs with which we can really do anything we want.

Few principles which makes learning computers very very easy and intuitive.

## Modular Abstraction
Two heavy words. But they are the most beautiful and satisfying concepts and you will love them if you write software for a living. Computers are built in a strict hierarchy, and each level is highly abstracted on top of the level below. Each level is also modular or functional. This means that each level has some **role**.  

What does this mean? An engineer or programmer does not really have to understand each level. They can play at the one which they are concerned with.

## Universal Computer
You can mimic any computer using any other computer to solve a problem, given sufficient time and memory.

What this means - Any computational system (transistor-Computers are cool. Lets learn about thembased, water pipes, neurons, leaves and twigs, etc) can simulate any other, provided it has enough resources.
A smartphone, a quantum computer, and a human brain (in theory) can all solve the same problems (though efficiency varies).

Why is this important? **Intelligence or creativity isnâ€™t tied to biology** - if a brain can compute something, a computer **could** theoretically do it too (given the right programming).

> I used new gpt to generate this comic strip. Its so much fun. I will add more such cute comics here and there. Its fun :)


The author of the book is brilliant. He talks about how computers are not just tools like a calculator or a paintbrush, but extensions of human thought. I really like this perspective. 


I am excited to learn and write. It takes a lot of time for me to write these, and it is not a bad thing (actually a good thing) because whatever I read, I try to break down, think, break down, argue, and finally come up with an understanding. AI is a big help here. Open Reasoning models are so good that I like to read their thinking. Gives a perspective.

Thank you for reading!
