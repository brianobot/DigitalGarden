# Are you a Genius or a Talented Learner?

So I have been reading blue lock manga from some time. There's a theory which the main character (Isagi) comes up with, that caught my attention. Over the past few months, I've been viewing the world from this theory's pov. Basically, Isagi views his opponents (and his teammates) as either "talented learners" or "geniuses".

>Geniuses possess innate, advantageous **traits**. Physical (ambidexterity, exceptional speed) or cognitive that set them apart from birth. These individuals represent evolutionary "mutations" that provide competitive advantages without deliberate cultivation.

>Talented learners, conversely, represent adaptation through effort. They lack inherent exceptional qualities but compensate through observation, analysis, and replication. Their strength lies in neuroplasticity. The ability to study, understand, and incorporate the techniques of geniuses into their own repertoire.

### Why am I so interested in this idea?
I feel learning this is a crucial step to optimize our lives. When you know what type of person you are, It becomes easier to follow along. I noticed this when I started learning RL, or started OS dev. I could figure out what works best for me, and double down on that method to learn something (optimally, since time is a luxury now)

Isagi himself is a talented learner, who tries to find plays which can outsmart geniuses.

Now you might call this bullshit, and you might be partially correct. But I do feel this theory is true to some extent. Maybe an evolved version of this theory, not exactly the same. 
You could be a genius in one aspect of life, but might not be in other. What you should do is to double down on what you think works best for you.

Nonetheless, its actually pretty cool to see a talented learner struggle to adapt to geniuses. Reminds me of myself.

My favorite sequence is when Isagi finds out Kaiser is also a talented learner
