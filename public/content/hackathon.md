On 12th November 2021, I took part in my first Hackathon conducted by my college. This post is all about my experience with hackathons and also working in a team(which was quite new to me).
Our App [Maver](https://github.com/theyashwanthsai/Maver-inGENIUS)

So the hackathon was about developing an idea which would help us become a better developer. An idea which could be scaled into a product. It was a 24 hour hackathon and we had to stay awake overnight and come up with a product.

Our idea was an app which would help students manage their monthly finance. With few inputs from our mentors we were able to make an app which was a great deal for us.

We made a Github repo and made it a public project. With more development in coming days we are sure to make a better application. Our team used MIT App Inventor(embarrassing) and added few features to the app. My teammate helped make the gui much better while i was working on database. We used Firebase DB and we managed to make something out of it.

## Final takeaways:-

Using MIT App Inventor was not really a good idea since we were not equipped with right of amount of knowledge. Knowledge of basic Javascript and knowing react.js would have placed us miles above. I should also focus on creating more projects.
Frontend is something not to be ignored and recently I have focused more on frontend part.

Need to focus on communication with teammates. I was lucky my teammate understood what was to be done and we somehow made something to show to the evaluators.

In the end, I made friends, learnt about team management and about how a product is made from idea part to execution part.
